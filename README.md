# Typedoc

## Version
- typescript: 5.2.2
- typedoc: 0.25.3
- nodejs: 20.6.1

## Findings
- Functions with export are included.
- index.ts modules files has to includes exports.
utils/index.ts
```
import { Greeter } from "./greeter";
import { Employee } from "./employee";

export { Greeter, Employee }
 
```

## package.json configuration
First need to add typedoc configuration to tsconfig.json
```
  "typedocOptions": {
    "entryPoints": ["src"],
    "entryPointStrategy": "expand",
    "out": "docs",
  },
```
Then update the scripts key on package.json file:
```
  "scripts": {
    "doc": "npx typedoc"
  },
```

## Including Js files
Changes on tsconfig.json
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true, 
     "outDir": "./dist",
  },
}    
```

- Every module's index.ts needs to be added to entryPoints attribute on tsconfig.json

## Automation process to deploy on Github pages

### Publish when changes are pushed to a specific branch
- Choose a specific branch in your GitHub repository. This branch can be any branch in your repository.
*Chosen branch: gh-pages*
- Define a source folder that contains your documentation files. It can be the root of the repository (/) on the source branch or a /docs folder on the source branch. This source folder should contain the documentation generated by TypeDoc.
*Chosen folder: /docs*

### Use GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site
This option provides more flexibility, especially if you want to use a build process other than Jekyll or if you don't want a dedicated branch for your compiled static files.
- Write a GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub provides starter workflows for common publishing scenarios, which can serve as a good starting point. You can customize the workflow to suit your needs.
- In the workflow, you can define the build process, which can include running TypeDoc to generate documentation.
- The workflow can be triggered by various events, such as pushing to a specific branch or creating a release. You have full control over when and how the documentation is built and published.
- Once the workflow is configured and triggered, it will execute the defined build process and deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.

## Create Action workflow

### Cretae .github/workflows/typedco-generator.yml file
```
name: Deploy TypeDoc on GitHub pages

on:
    push:
      branches:
        - gh-pages  

env:
  NODE_VERSION: 18.x
  ENTRY_FILE: 'src'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build documentation
        uses: zakodium/typedoc-action@v2
        with:
          entry: ${{ env.ENTRY_FILE }}
      - name: Deploy to GitHub pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: docs
          clean: true
      # - name: Deploy
      #   uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      #   with:
      #     github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      #     publish_dir: ./docs 
```
