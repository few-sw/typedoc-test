## Automation process to deploy on Github pages

### Publish when changes are pushed to a specific branch (selected method)
- Choose a specific branch in your GitHub repository. This branch can be any branch in your repository.
*Chosen branch: gh-pages*
- Define a source folder that contains your documentation files. It can be the root of the repository (/) on the source branch or a /docs folder on the source branch. This source folder should contain the documentation generated by TypeDoc.
*Chosen folder: /docs*

### Use GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site
This option provides more flexibility, especially if you want to use a build process other than Jekyll or if you don't want a dedicated branch for your compiled static files.
- Write a GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub provides starter workflows for common publishing scenarios, which can serve as a good starting point. You can customize the workflow to suit your needs.
- In the workflow, you can define the build process, which can include running TypeDoc to generate documentation.
- The workflow can be triggered by various events, such as pushing to a specific branch or creating a release. You have full control over when and how the documentation is built and published.
- Once the workflow is configured and triggered, it will execute the defined build process and deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.

### package.json configuration
First need to add typedoc configuration to tsconfig.json
```
  "typedocOptions": {
    "entryPoints": ["src"],
    "entryPointStrategy": "expand",
    "out": "docs",
  },
```
Then update the scripts key on package.json file:
```
  "scripts": {
    "doc": "npx typedoc"
  },
```

## Including Js files
Changes on tsconfig.json
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true, 
     "outDir": "./dist",
     "include": ["src/**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts"] 
  },
}    
```
